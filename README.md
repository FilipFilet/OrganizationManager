# What is OrganizationManager?
OrganizationManager is an SPA im developing in React for two reasons, both to deepen my understanding of React, but also to provide a client for my ApiLog API, to be able to test the two way communication i want to implement in that project.

Right now theres not much too see other than static elements grouped in React components, but it is still a work in progress.
